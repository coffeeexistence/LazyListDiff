    // Use-case: Ultra-lightweight diffing algo specifically for use in UICollectionView performBatchUpdates.
    //
    // Advantages:
    // - Perf: O(n) perfomance where n is visible cells. O(1) perf relative to total cell count.
    // Instead of diffing 200 - 500,000 items in memory, you can just diff the 24 visible indexPaths.
    // - Memory: This diffing algo doesn't require all items to be loaded into memory, just the visible ones.
    //
    // Considerations:
    // - Although the diff for visible items is accurate, inserts/deletions based on totalCount changes
    // are approximate.
    // - Performing batchUpdates based on a diff that was calculated based on outdated visible indexPaths
    // will result in incorrect cell appearance, the diff is only accurate for the visible cells
    // when it was computed.
    // - Since collectionView.indexPathsForVisibleItems can change at any moment, diffing must be
    // performed on the main thread and then immediately (synchronously) applied.
    // - These diffs are suitable for purely index-based collections.
    // - Only single-section layouts are supported at the moment.

    ///     UICollectionViewCell ready in memory to be displayed. Deleting cells in this this location is more expensive, and so we should
    ///     minimize the odds of that happening by extending LazyDiff's working range.

    /// `collectionView(cellForItemAt`.
